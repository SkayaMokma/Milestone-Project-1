This game was inspired by my two favorite games: Zelda and Elden Ring (hence the name "Zelden). 
I wanted to make a brain-puzzle style game with a pretty landscape. 
Controls and How to Play:
    The silhouette character on screen is controlled with the arrow keys. 
    Five silhouette "items" around the map are able to be picked up and moved to the inventory by clicking on them with the mouse. Upon being clicked, the player will have to answer a riddle before moving on. If answered incorrectly, one of the player's "lives" at the top of the screen will be removed. Once all of the items are collected and the riddles are answered, if the player still has hearts remaining, they win. If/when all of the hearts are lost, the player loses.
